# Goal
We want to create a tool which allows Boston officials to know which stops would
provide the most benefit to the public with respect to government income if the 
stop was removed.

We plan on doing this by ranking bus stops by the area's average income level, 
and the amount of revenue a bus stop generates.

Our team will be focusing on the Brockton Dataset

# Datasets
