# Goal
Explore the feasibility and impact of expanding free RTA bus lines in Massachusetts.

We plan on doing this by ranking bus stops based on area's average income level, population and the amount of revenue a bus stop generates.

# Installation
Install rtc_transit_equity locally. For example, call the following code snippet from within the directory `transit-equity`:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install .
```

If you have difficulty installing Rtree or xlrd, please see the [rtree docs](https://toblerity.org/rtree/) for installation assistance. 

# Datasets
We pulled data using the following datasets:

1. [Bus Stop Geometry JSON](https://gis.massdot.state.ma.us/arcgis/rest/services/Multimodal/RTAs/FeatureServer/1/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=json)

2. [Bus Route Geometry CSV](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1cb5c63d6f114f8a94c6d5a0e03ae62e_0.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A3857%2C%22wkid%22%3A102100%7D)

3. [RTA Ridership XLSX](https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2020-10/August%202020%20Adjusted%20Database.xlsx)

4. [Census Population Data JSON](https://api.census.gov/data/2018/pep/population?get=COUNTY,DATE_CODE,DATE_DESC,DENSITY,POP,GEONAME,STATE&for=county:*&in=state:25)

5. [Bus Routes Shape Files](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1cb5c63d6f114f8a94c6d5a0e03ae62e_0.zip)

6. [Bus Stops Shape Files](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/9f0b255b1a314b70a396d93d4425f531_1.zip)

After pulling this data, we preprocess it to feature engineer our internal csv files. To pull the data and preprocess simply run the following code:

```python
from rtc_transit_equity import generate
data = generate()
```

The above code will generate a data folder and populate it with the necessary datasets. The variable data will be a dictionary containing all our significant datasets. You may view [Strategic Questions](https://github.com/cumason123/transit-equity/blob/master/notebooks/StrategicQuestions.ipynb) on example usage. Subsequent calls to generate will use the local file cached results. You can circumvent these local cache files by using the following code snippet:

```python
from rtc_transit_equity import generate
data = generate(regenerate=True)
```

# Strategic Questions
1. What bus routes and stops, if made free, would most benefit low income riders in Massachusetts?

2. Which towns and districts would most benefit by a policy change to the fare change to these routes?

3. What would the cost be to the MBTA and regional transit authorities for each proposed bus route/stop/zones based on ridership and fare costs?

4. What would the cost be to make an entire regional transit area free and how would this compare?

We answer these questions in our final report, and also here: [Strategic Questions](https://github.com/cumason123/transit-equity/blob/master/notebooks/StrategicQuestions.ipynb).
