# Goal
We want to create a tool which allows Boston officials to know which stops would
provide the most benefit to the public with respect to government income if the 
stop was removed.

We plan on doing this by ranking bus stops by the area's average income level, 
and the amount of revenue a bus stop generates.

Our team will be focusing on the Brockton Dataset

# Datasets
Can be found in the python notebooks unders the src folder.

# Strategic Questions
1. What bus routes and stops, if made free, would most benefit low income riders in Massachusetts?

2. Which towns and districts would most benefit by a policy change to the fare change to these routes?

3. What would the cost be to the MBTA and regional transit authorities for each proposed bus route/stop/zones based on ridership and fare costs?

4. What would the cost be to make an entire regional transit area free and how would this compare?
